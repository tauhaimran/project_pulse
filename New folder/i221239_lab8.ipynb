        "# **Employee Shift Scheduling A Constraints Satisfiction problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are tasked with developing an automated scheduling system that assigns employees to work shifts over a given period (e.g., one week). The assignment must satisfy several constraints to ensure fairness and operational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Objectives**\n",
        "- **CSP Modeling:** Formulate the scheduling problem as a CSP by defining variables, domains, and constraints.\n",
        "- **Search Techniques:** Implement search strategies such as backtracking, along with heuristics like Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) and Most Constraining Variable (MCV).\n",
        "- **Constraint Propagation:** Use techniques such as AC-3 to reduce the domain of possibilities for each shift before and during search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Problem Description**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Schedule Structure**\n",
        "- **Time Frame:** Consider a schedule spanning 5 days (Monday through Friday).\n",
        "- **Shifts per Day:** Each day is divided into 3 shifts: Morning, Afternoon, and Night.\n",
        "- **Employees:** You have a fixed list of employees available for scheduling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Inputs**\n",
        "1. **List of Employees:** An array of employee names (e.g., [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Carol\", \"Dave\"]).\n",
        "2. **Employee Availability:**: For each employee, a dictionary indicating the shifts or days they are available to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Constraints**\n",
        "1. **Daily Work Limit:** Each employee can work at most one shift per day.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Availability Constraint:** An employee can only be assigned to a shift if they are available for that day/shift.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Expected Output**\n",
        "- **Schedule Grid:** A 5Ã—3 grid (or equivalent structure) where each cell shows the assigned employee for that day and shift.\n",
        "    For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    | Day       | Morning | Afternoon | Night |\n",
        "    |-----------|---------|-----------|-------|\n",
        "    | Monday    | Alice   | Carol     | Dave  |\n",
        "    | Tuesday   | Carol   | Bob       | Dave  |\n",
        "    | Wednesday | ...     | ...       | ...   |\n",
        "    | Thursday  | ...     | ...       | ...   |\n",
        "    | Friday    | ...     | ...       | ...   |\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Feasibility:**\n",
        "The produced schedule must satisfy all the constraints:\n",
        "- No employee is scheduled more than once per day.\n",
        "- Only available employees are assigned to shifts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Overall Process**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **For Each Day in the Week:**\n",
        "   - **Initialize Daily Variables and Domains:**\n",
        "     - Build a `daySchedule` mapping each shift (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Night) to an employee assignment (initially set to `None`).\n",
        "     - Build `dayDomains` for each shift based on employee availability for that day.\n",
        "   - **Run AC-3 for Constraint Propagation:**\n",
        "     - Apply AC-3 to prune the domains of each shift using the \"one shift per day\" rule (i.e., no employee can work more than one shift per day).\n",
        "   - **Perform Backtracking Search:**\n",
        "     - **Select the Next Variable (Shift) using MRV:**  \n",
        "       Choose the shift with the smallest remaining domain.\n",
        "     - **Order Possible Assignments using LCV:**  \n",
        "       Prioritize employee assignments that eliminate the fewest options for other shifts.\n",
        "     - **Assign Employees and Check Consistency:**  \n",
        "       Assign an employee to the chosen shift and verify that the assignment does not violate the constraints.\n",
        "     - **Backtracking:**  \n",
        "       If a dead-end occurs (i.e., a shift's domain becomes empty), backtrack to previous assignments and try alternative values.\n",
        "   - **Store the Daily Schedule:**\n",
        "     - Once all shifts for the day have been successfully assigned, store the day's schedule in the overall `weeklySchedule`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Return the Weekly Schedule:**\n",
        "   - After processing every day, return the complete `weeklySchedule`."
